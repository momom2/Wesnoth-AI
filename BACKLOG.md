# BACKLOG

Live backlog for `docs/plan_20260904.md`. The pre-restart backlog
(1,055 lines of rulings and open items, 2026-05 to 2026-09-04) is
archived verbatim at `docs/archive/backlog_20260904.md`.

## NEXT ACTIONS (phase 1: engineering, in order)

1. **Benchmark harness** (plan 1.1): DONE 2026-09-04, baseline in
   `docs/box_specs.md` and `training/metrics/bench_pipeline/`. Per
   decision: 10.1 ms of Python (enumerate priors 6.9 including the
   2.2 ms mask build, encoding 2.5, sim step 0.7; an earlier quote of
   12.4 counted the masks twice) against 5.2 ms per forward; batched forwards plateau at ~600 samples/s per process
   from batch 16 (CPU-side ceiling). Raw game 35 s, searched game
   160 s at 10 jobs, one process per game. Open: run it on a second
   box shape with the Rust wheel built (`scripts/bench_box.sh` now
   builds it) to pin the reproducibility band.
2. **Per-decision Python work** (plan 1.2), ordered by the measured
   cost: enumeration 6.9 ms, masks 2.2 (Python path) / ~0.5 (Rust),
   encoding 2.5, sim step 0.7; fork and deepcopy are 0.05 ms already
   (the Rust plan's phase 4 "cheap fork" is not where the time is).
   - DONE 2026-09-04: vectorized enumeration
     (`enumerate_legal_actions_with_priors`, reference kept as
     `_enumerate_legal_actions_reference`, `WESNOTH_ENUM_REFERENCE=1`
     forces it; differential test `tests/test_enumerate_vectorized.py`):
     7.3 -> 3.8 ms on the laptop including the mask build; the
     combat-oracle damage computation in the mask builder is skipped
     when both oracle alphas are 0 (they are). The floor is now the
     construction of ~600-700 action objects per state; the
     struct-of-arrays output that removes it belongs to the server
     step below (arrays are what cross processes cheaply).
   - Measured on the box with the Rust wheel: masks 0.76 ms,
     enumeration incl. masks 2.53 ms (was 6.90).
   - DONE 2026-09-04: Rust `encode_raw` streams (rust_port_plan phase
     2b, `rust/wesnoth_core/src/encode.rs`, byte-identical on 124
     states in both hex modes, `tests/test_rust_encode_raw.py`):
     634 -> 391 us per encode on the laptop with fog on (the residue is
     the fog visibility computation), 112 -> 56 us fog off. Box
     measurement pending (wheel rebuild in the box setup).
   - NEXT: the actor loop's untimed ~45 ms per leaf (see 3.), then
     combat and step (phase 3, full corpus sweep).
3. **Batched inference server** (plan 1.3). Measured 2026-09-04
   (docs/box_specs.md "Phase-1 iterations"): the batched forward ran
   fp32 eager (only the single-sample path had bf16 and compile);
   with bf16 it does 1,584 samples/s at batch 16 (was 602). The
   server-side priors protocol (`wesnoth_ai/server_priors.py`: actors
   ship packed masks, the server returns compact legal actions,
   `ActorPool.server_priors`, default ON since 2026-09-04) serves ~1,080 leaves/s
   per thread on token-sorted batches with 9-15 KB per leaf on the
   wire (was 60-87 KB). Certified: parity tests through seam and
   wire, pool smoke end to end.
   - MEASURED through the real pool (docs/box_specs.md "Generation
     throughput"): az-leg configuration 141 leaves/s -> priors on 172
     -> priors + bf16 320 leaves/s, 33 -> 64 games/h, same box. The
     serve threads share one GIL and were busy 60-75% of the time:
     the server is still the ceiling.
   - DEFAULTS FLIPPED (2026-09-04): `ActorPool(server_priors=True)`
     and the server's own bf16 switch (`InferenceServer(autocast_bf16)`,
     `ActorPool(infer_bf16)`); `az_loop.py --server-priors/--infer-bf16`
     default on (cuda), `--no-...` to opt out. The learner's in-process
     probes keep the model's precision.
   - Coalescing 64 leaves per server batch instead of 16: 364 leaves/s
     against 320 (`pool_mb64`), so per-batch Python is a minor cost.
   - PROFILED (docs/box_specs.md, server profile): the server is
     under-fed, not saturated. Serve threads wait on the queue 53% of
     the time, GPU at 49%, actors at ~50% CPU: 19 actors with one
     16-leaf request in flight each cannot fill the pipeline. The GIL
     is held ~25% of wall time; half of that was unpickling requests.
   - SHIPPED: packed requests (`wesnoth_ai/leaf_wire.py`, one buffer
     per request); server torch threads capped at 4 (358 leaves/s
     against 279-320 uncapped, edge of the ~13% run-to-run noise).
   - GPU-SIDE DESIGN (docs/gpu_forward_design_20260904.md): GPU time
     per 16-leaf batch at production sizes is ~24 ms (fed ceiling ~670
     leaves/s with today's kernels); the physical floor at 1,270
     tokens per leaf is ~2,950 leaves/s at 100% of the 4090's bf16
     peak, so the plan's 3,000 needs fewer tokens per leaf (plan 1.4),
     not better kernels. Ranked GPU levers: sync/copy consolidation
     in `batched_priors` (-8-12%), packed varlen trunk (-20-25%),
     inductor compile of a tensor-only `forward_streams` (-15-20% GPU,
     -50% CPU), length-bucketed coalescing (-8-10% at 16, -30% at 64);
     CUDA graphs never unless CPU is the limit again. All of it only
     pays once the server is fed.
   - THE ACTOR IS THE CEILING: the actor's cycle per 16-leaf request
     is ~0.95 s of which the server's response is ~0.1 s, i.e. ~50 ms
     of actor wall per leaf against ~5 ms of benchmarked components
     (encode, masks, unpack, fork+step). The search loop itself
     (selection, expansion into ~350 action objects, backup, GC) is
     untimed. NEXT: profile one searched game in-process
     (py-spy as parent of elo_eval_game --mcts-sims 32) and attribute
     the missing ~45 ms per leaf; then fix the largest item; then more
     requests in flight (28 actors on the 17.5-core quota; 38 actors
     killed the box's sshd on 2026-09-04).
   - Persistent eval workers shipped (`run_elo_batch
     --persistent-workers`, tools/eval_workers.py): 20 seed-vs-seed
     games at 10 concurrent in 97 s against 408 s one-process
     (docs/box_specs.md, evaluation section). An 800-game gate is
     about 65 minutes of one 4090 box. The first build shared one
     policy object between the two sides (3 of 20 games diverged);
     fixed, and the replay agrees exactly with the one-process games
     across repeated runs: the argmax harness is deterministic.
4. **Defects** (plan 1.6): DONE 2026-09-04.
   - `tools/az_loop.py` `_probe` passes `--raw-temperature-a 0
     --raw-temperature-b 0` at sims 0 (every earlier pin compared the
     sampling player on both sides).
   - `tools/step_control.py`: `_clone_weights`/`publish_weights` cover
     the encoder too (flat dict, `model.`/`encoder.` prefixes); the
     restore test checks both encoders.
   - `tests/test_actor_pool_watchdog.py`: the stub carries
     `value_center` and `server_priors`; green.
   - Eval search procedure per player: `--gumbel-root-a/-b`
     (`elo_eval_game`, `run_elo_batch`; default on), procedure tag
     `puct:<sims>` for a plain PUCT root, recorded in the result JSON.
5. **Model cost study** (plan 1.4) and **eval at scale** (plan 1.5).
6. **Review of the day's changes** (2026-09-04, 7 Opus finders + 3
   refuters per finding): 17 confirmed, 16 fixed the same day (static
   hex cache keyed on a freed address; timeout artifacts that aborted
   every cuda resume; `random` cached across worker games; refusal
   reasons lost in worker mode; per-player root flag recorded for
   arms that never read it; bench rates over truncated runs and over
   surplus actors; double-counted masks; reused bench outdirs; seam
   token and short-batch arithmetic; the priors protocol now refuses
   a nonzero combat-oracle anneal instead of ignoring it). Open:
   `RemoteEncoder.encode` packs masks for every encode, including
   value-only ones (turn search, probes); an `encode(want_priors)`
   switch when those paths return to use.

## Phase 2 prerequisite (measure before designing)

- Turn-level value gap: four alternative whole turns at 60 boundary
  positions, 40 playouts each; fraction of positions where the best
  alternative differs from the base's turn by at least 0.25 in
  expected outcome. About $1.3 at current efficiency. Under 5% kills
  rollout-graded turn search.

## Cheap measurements worth taking

- DONE 2026-09-05 (docs/box_specs.md "Raw player temperature"):
  temperature sweep 0 / 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 vs `raw:t0`, 40 games each.
  `raw:t0` vs itself: 14-9 with 17 stalls at the 200-turn cap (median
  125 turns); `raw:t0.5`: 22-18, no stalls, median 31 turns;
  `raw:t1`: 7-33. Open: an 800-game match 0.5 vs 0 to decide the
  reference's deployment temperature.
- Re-baseline the Elo catalog (`training/metrics/elo_catalog.json`)
  on `raw:t0`: four edges against the local checkpoints (2291k,
  2516k, l4-495k, tcs2-558k) queued on the box 2026-09-05.

## Ops notes that are still true

- Boxes: propose specs and cost, wait for a yes, `vms_enabled=false`,
  CPU model EPYC or Ryzen, destroy at the end (`yes | vastai destroy
  instance <id>`; the CLI prompts).
- Launch a detached job over ssh in one call and verify in another;
  the launching session hangs while the child runs.
- No compute on the laptop beyond sub-minute microbenchmarks.
